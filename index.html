            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>My hobbies include snowboarding, ice skating, cooking, and drawing. I started snowboarding when I was
                   around eight years old and I am still learning since then.
                   Because it is now my hobby, I wish to go somewhere in the mountains where it is snowing as a dream vacation.
                   However, I would like to visit many places outside this country such as: Italy, Spain, Japan, Canada, and France.</p>
                <p>However, I wouldn't be able to do that without my family. I have one blood related brother, two half related brothers, two step brothers, and one step sister.
                   Fortunately, I do not have them all in the same house. Whenever I am not with my family, 
                   I like to spend my free time wasting it on the internet.</p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                    <p>Some long term goals I would like to accomplish is to become a multimillionaire and to be able to be a professional in snowboarding.
                       I know it will take years of practice, especially since there IS NO winter in California. To achieve the idea of becoming a
                       millionaire, I would have to work hard, or make a product that everyone would use. 
                       However, that is not all. I would also want to become an accomplished artisan. It will take many months and years in agony, 
                       until I can accomplish these goals in my life.</p>
                <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                    <p>I have many short term goals as well. In fact, I want to be able to learn how to do a toe edge in snowboarding,
                       learn how to spin while ice skating, learn how to animate dynamic movements, and to learn how to cook or bake an explicit gourmet without using directions.
                       Even though some things may take longer than usual, I know that I can accomplish these goals quickly. By that means, I would have to wait until I am able to find these goals for time is one of the most important factors when being able to reach a goal.
                       I hope that I will be able to master these goals to achieve my long term goals as well.</p>
            <h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>Some educational accomplishments wouSld be such things as learning the English alphabet, learning how to add and to subtract, being able to read words, and learning how to design webs. It is always nice to learn a new language because it helps us to flex through different cultures and understandings of others. 
                    When I learned how to read, I knew that there were more words to find in the English language as words are growing as people create new ones or bring the old.
                    Math has a love-hate relationship with me for some things are very complicated as on the other hand, it just as singing the English alphabet.</p>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>A few personal accomplishments in my life would be the little things that count in life. 
                       I learned how to ice skate faster and backwards over the winter break and I also learned how to snowboard a tad faster. 
                       It wasnâ€™t easy, for I am afraid to fall down. However, it will not stop me from accomplishing this goal. I also learned how to become more independent in my life without the help of others.
                       I am a visual learner, so for that fact, I learned by watching others draw and ice skate.</p>
